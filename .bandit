[bandit]
# Bandit configuration for SecAudit+
# This is a security auditing tool, so we legitimately use subprocess, shell commands, etc.

# Exclude test directories
exclude_dirs = ['/test', '/tests', 'test_*', '*_test.py', '/venv', '/.venv']

# Skip these checks (false positives for security auditing tool):
# B404 - Import subprocess (needed for command execution)
# B603 - subprocess without shell=True (actually MORE secure!)
# B607 - Starting process with partial path (ping, etc. are system commands)
# B105 - Hardcoded password string (false positive for "*" glob pattern)
# B108 - Hardcoded temp directory (standard /tmp usage)
# B110 - Try/Except/Pass (sometimes legitimate for cleanup)
# B112 - Try/Except/Continue (sometimes legitimate for iteration)
# B405 - XML ElementTree (used for generation, not parsing untrusted input)
# B104 - Binding to all interfaces (just IP comparison, not actual binding)
skips = ['B404','B603','B607','B105','B108','B110','B112','B405','B104']

# B602 (shell=True) - We'll keep this check but mark specific locations as safe
# This ensures we're aware when using shell=True

# Confidence levels to report
confidence = ['HIGH']

# Severity levels to report (only HIGH to reduce noise)
severity = ['HIGH']
